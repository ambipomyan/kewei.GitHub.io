## Welcome to My Page

### Overview
I am in High Performance Computing Architecture and System (HPCAS) Laboratory at University of North Carolina at Charlotte advised by Dr. Yonghong Yan.
My research interest is in field of HPC, especially for performance analysis/optimization based on strategy of memory managment and tuning framework.
My main programming language is C/C++, also have experience with SAS/R/python/matlab.

For now I am working on multiple reaserch including 
`memory management solutions to heterogeneous computation`
and
`performance optimization for complex application`
I do also have some other reserch experiences in the field of biostatistics/bioinfomatics including
`RNA alignment`
and 
`pharmacokinetics simulation`
